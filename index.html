      <h2>App Functionality</h2>
      <p>In this app, students can visualize how velocity and acceleration affect physical movement. They can change the velocity and acceleration to see how it impacts various objects in motion.</p>

      <h3>Velocity</h3>
      <p>Velocity is a vector quantity that describes the rate at which an object changes its position in a specific direction. It is measured in meters per second (m/s). In the app, students can adjust the velocity of objects to observe how their speed and direction change accordingly.</p>

      <h3>Acceleration</h3>
      <p>Acceleration is the rate of change of an object's velocity concerning time. It is also a vector quantity and is measured in meters per second squared (m/sÂ²). Students can manipulate the acceleration of objects in the app to witness how it affects the object's motion, such as increasing or decreasing its speed or changing its direction.</p>
